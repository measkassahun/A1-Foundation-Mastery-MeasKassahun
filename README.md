# Background Research
1. [Many rallied in Texas to fight against the state's most restrictive law yet, which bans abortion after just 6 weeks](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/10/03/its-serious-thousands-rally-for-reproductive-rights-across-tampa-bay/)
2. [Police officers trapped(kettled) and assaulted many protesters during a peaceful protest against police brutality](https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/09/30/kettling-protesters-bronx/systemic-police-brutality-and-its-costs-united-states#)

# Analysis
1. What does the difference between the mean and the median tell you about the distribution of the data?

 Because the mean is greater than the median, this indicatesÂ that the data distribution is positively skewed.
 
2. Does the number of protests in Washington surprise you? Why or why not?

No, this wasn't quite suprising because, Washington is a state which is known to be inclusive of people from various backgrounds.

3. Looking at the state_table variable, what data quality issues do you notice, and how would you use that to change your analysis (no need to actually change your analysis)?

A quality issue I noticed is some duplications is state names, due the text having varity between upper and lower case letters. ( Ex: WA, vs cL)

4. Does the change in the number of protests from 2019 to 2020 surprise you? Why or why not?

No, this isn't suprising because, there has been a rise in protest especially following growth and heavy infuence of social media.

5. Do a bit of research. Find at least two specific policies that have been changed as a result of protests in 2020. These may be at the city, state, or University level. Please provide a basic summary, as well as a link to each article.

- [Minneapolis announced that they reached an agreement with the state to ban chokeholds following Blacklivesmatter protests around the country](https://www.vox.com/2020/6/10/21283966/protests-george-floyd-police-reform-policy)
- [The US Marine Corps officially banned displays of the Confederate flag in any public and work spaces on its bases following protests of racist symbols and statues](https://www.vox.com/2020/6/10/21283966/protests-george-floyd-police-reform-policy)

6. Take a look (View()) your high_level_table variable. What picture does this paint of the U.S.?

I think it shows that we have a long ways to go, and many issues to work through.

# Critical Reflection
1. How was the dataset collected and who collected the data?

The dataset was collected using local news reports.

2. What assumptions does the dataset make? List atleast two assumptions you identified. For inspiration, check out this blog post that describes one method for identifying data assumptions.

- Assumption 1: This was a large poll of data, and since it was collected through local news reports, my first assumption was that the data would vary based on news coverage; considering smaller portest may not have little to no news coverage, thus could possibly be excluded from overall data. 
- Assumption 2: There would be a larger precedent of protests in certain areas more than others, which lead me to assume that there would be coorelation between number of protest and number of social issues in said regions. 

3. What data is missing from the dataset? Think about if there are any data points you would have liked to have seen in the dataset.

In the data set I think it would've been helpful to have some color varation to idicate differnt data points, especially on the map of the U.S.

# Final Thoughts
1. What about the analysis surprised you?

I was very suprised just to see the numerical prevalence of protests within the last 2-3 years, I think that there is a lot to learn from looking at the recent changes in why and how people have been advoating for themselves and the issue they care about. 

2. What parts of this analysis did you find challenging?

For me the most challenging part of this analysis, is the coding aspect because i am still learning and it took the longest time to complete.

3. What types of analysis do you wish you were able to do with the dataset, but currently don't have the technical skills to do?

I do wish maybe there was someway to use the dataset to create a list of social issues by the number of attendees
